# Show the key fix in the source files
echo "1. CONDITIONAL HEADER INCLUSION FIX:"
echo "   The main issue was that single-core builds were trying to include sysbuild-generated headers."
echo "   Solution: Conditional compilation based on build mode detection."
echo
echo "   In both cm7/src/main.c and cm4/src/main.c:"

# Show the CMake detection logic
echo "2. BUILD MODE DETECTION IN CMAKE:"
echo "   CMakeLists.txt automatically detects whether we're in sysbuild mode."
echo
echo "   In both cm7/CMakeLists.txt and cm4/CMakeLists.txt:"
grep -A 5 "Check if we're in a sysbuild context" samples/open_amp_rust/cm7/CMakeLists.txt

# Show the three build modes
echo "3. SUPPORTED BUILD MODES:"
echo
echo "   Mode 1 - CM7 Only (Single Core):"
echo "   west build -b mimxrt1160_evk/mimxrt1166/cm7 samples/open_amp_rust/cm7 -p always"
echo "   → CONFIG_OPENAMP_SYSBUILD = OFF"

echo
echo "   Mode 2 - CM4 Only (Single Core):"
echo "   west build -b mimxrt1160_evk/mimxrt1166/cm4 samples/open_amp_rust/cm4 -p always"
echo "   → CONFIG_OPENAMP_SYSBUILD = OFF"
echo "   → zephyr_image_info.h NOT included"
echo
echo "   Mode 3 - Multi-Core (Sysbuild):"
echo "   west build -b mimxrt1160_evk/mimxrt1166/cm7 --sysbuild samples/open_amp_rust/cm7 -p always"
echo "   → CONFIG_OPENAMP_SYSBUILD = ON"
echo "   → zephyr_image_info.h IS included"

echo

echo "5. KEY SOLUTION COMPONENTS:"
echo "   ✓ Conditional header inclusion (#ifdef CONFIG_OPENAMP_SYSBUILD)"
echo "   ✓ Automatic sysbuild detection in CMakeLists.txt"
echo "   ✓ Proper Kconfig configuration"
echo "   ✓ Rust integration with no_std embedded setup"
echo "   ✓ Separate build configurations for each core"
echo "   ✓ Sysbuild configuration for multi-core builds"
echo

echo "6. WHAT WAS FIXED:"
echo "   BEFORE: Single-core builds failed with 'zephyr_image_info.h: No such file or directory'"
echo "   AFTER:  All three build modes work correctly with conditional compilation"
echo

echo "=== Solution Complete ==="
echo "The project now supports all requested build modes without header inclusion errors."
